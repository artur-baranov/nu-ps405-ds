# Country-Year Fixed Effects Model

Let's explore Comparative Political Dataset. It consists of political and institutional country-level data. Take a look on their [codebook](https://cpds-data.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/codebook_cpds.pdf).

Today we are working with the following variables.

-   `prefisc_gini` - Gini index. What is it?

-   `openc` - Openness of the economy

-   `servadmi_pmp` - Public and mandatory private employment services and administration as a percentage of GDP.


Homoscedasticity assumption 

Ways to solve the problem:

-   Use another model (e.g., if you're dealing with binary dependent variable, you can use logit)

-   Transform DV
